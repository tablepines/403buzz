1. Refer to lines 9 - 33

# Clock exercises 
1. Refer to line 36. core.wait is pretty precise, close to 2 seconds.
2. Refer to line 144-158 This method is less accurate than the previous, showing more ms off. But overall, they are all mostly close in time!
3. Refer to line 163-197
4. Refer to code. Lines 40-96.

# Frame-based timing exercises
1. Refer to the code from line 105 and beyond. Less than 20 frames (~ 1 frame per trial) is dropped, so frame-based timing is kept rather then CountdownTimer.
