Print Exercise 
1) See file vivian.py
2) No variable shows up in the variable editor 

Operation Exercise 
1) See file Level0_403.py
2) When dividing 5/2 in the integer format, the answer is rounded to the next whole number. While in float, the answer is exact with decimals.
3) Modulo returns the remainder after dividing two numbers. 
4) The ** operator squares a number. For example, 5 ** 2 indicates 5 squared to equal to 25. For the // operator, the numbers are divided leaving only the integer result and discarding the remainder. 
5) Python follows the order of operations, using what is in the brackets first, followed by others in BED/BODMAS.

Variable Excercise
1) See file vivian.py
2) After assigning the letters of our name to a variable label, the variable explorer window, previously empty, now shows a table with 4 categories: Name, Type, Size and Value. Name is the variable label assigned to each letter, for example letter1, letter2, etc., Type is the type of input we used which is str (string), Size is 1, and Value shows the assigned letter to each variable. For example, V for letter1. 
3) After adjusting letter4 to letterX variable, python did not have a problem with printing the different variables with the same value. It was still ablt to print out 'i' twice.
4) In a new line, after reassigning the variable letterX to a new letter not in my name, which in this case is 's', rather than 'i', then printing this letterX and letter2, letter2 is still 'i', however, letterX is now reassigned to print 's' as the variable is updated.
5) *The value of letterX did not change after reassigning a new value to letter6. letterX only gets assigned to what letter 2 was then, but after updating letter6 letterX was not updated. 

Boolean Exercise 
1) See file Level0_403.py
2) Yes, 1 and 1.0 are equivelent. They represent the same number and value, however just written in different types. For example, 1 is written as an integer, whereas 1.0 is written in a float. However, "1" is not the same as "1.0", as they are different strings. 
3) After checking to see if 5 is equivelent to (3+2), python returns "True" in console to indicate that. 
4) All 5 ways, interchanging X or, and, and not, have been listed in the script. 

List Excercise 
1) See file Level0_403.py
2) After creating oddlist, it became a variable however instead of its type being a str with previous variables, it became a list with size 11 (11 values from 0 to 10 integer) in the list. 
3) Python says the length of oddlist is 11, it counts 0 apart of the list.
4) When inputting type(oddlist), the output is <class 'list>. This indicates that the type is a list. 
5) Refer to the script file to see all integers 0 to 100 printed. 

Dictionary Exercise 
1) See file Level0_403.py 
2) Python determines the length of the dictionary by how many items are defined in the dictinary. 

Array Excercise
1) See file Level0_403.py
2) All values turned into a float. 
3) All values were turned into strings.
